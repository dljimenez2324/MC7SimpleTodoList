<strong>Description:</strong>

Requirements:
Create a To-Do List
Add items to the list
Complete an item on the list (crossing out)
Delete an item
Edit an item

Stylize your To-Do list. This means styling your application in a thoughtful and meaningful way that is not the way we did it in class.

Find two bugs and fix them.

<b>Bugs found & fixed:</b> <br>
* when trying to add react icons to my Todo.tsx in the return I saw this error on my localhost screen "Cannot find module 'react-icons/fa' or its corresponding type declarations.ts(2307)"
  * In order to fix this, I found that I had to run "npm install react-icons --save" in order for my react-icons to be imported in my  node_modules
  * After installing I would use this site "https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/" to find the exact icons I wish to use and import the icon and use the tag as required
